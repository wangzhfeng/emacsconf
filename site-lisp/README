This is a place for 3rd party code which isn't available in MELPA or
other package repositories. This directory and its immediate subdirectories
will be added to load-path at start-up time.

Notably, in Emacs 23.x, a backported package.el is automatically
downloaded and installed here.

第三方包必须按照site-lisp/package-name/package-name.el存放，否则加载不到。
